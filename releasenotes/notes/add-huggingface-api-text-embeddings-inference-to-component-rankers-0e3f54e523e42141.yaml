    Added new `HuggingFaceTEIRanker` component to support text-embeddings-inference service
     for rerank models. This implementation allows integration with models like BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3
     through HuggingFace Inference API. with both synchronous (`run`) and asynchronous (`run_async`) execution modes.
    Unit tests included in `test/components/rankers/test_hugging_face_tei.py`
     (requires running text-embeddings-inference service BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3 for test execution).
